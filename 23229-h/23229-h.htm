<p>The very interesting and richly coloured masque or pantomimic
play which is here printed in book form for the first time, was
invented sometime in 1894 or possibly a little earlier.&nbsp; It
was written, not for publication, but as a personal gift to the
author&rsquo;s friend and friend of his family, Mrs. Chan Toon,
and was sent to her with the letter that follows and explains its
origin.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chan Toon, before her marriage to Mr. Chan Toon, a
Burmese gentleman, nephew of the King of Burma and a barrister of
the Middle Temple, was Miss <!-- page iv--><a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>Mabel
Cosgrove, the daughter of Mr. Ernest Cosgrove of Lancaster Gate,
a friend of Sir William and Lady Wilde, and herself brought up
with Oscar and his brother Willie.</p>
<p>For a long while Mrs. Chan Toon, who after her husband&rsquo;s
death became Mrs. Woodhouse-Pearse, refused to permit the masque
to be printed.&nbsp; The late Robert Ross much wanted to include
it in an edition of Wilde&rsquo;s works, of which it now forms a
part, but he could not obtain its owner&rsquo;s consent.&nbsp; An
arrangement, however, having been completed, the play is now made
public.</p>

<p><i>My dear Mrs. Chan Toon</i>,</p>
<p><i>I am greatly repentant being so long in acknowledging
receipt of</i> &ldquo;<i>Told on the Pagoda</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<i>I enjoyed reading the stories</i>, <i>and much admired their
quaint and delicate charm</i>.&nbsp; <i>Burmah calls to
me</i>.</p>
<p><i>Under another cover I am sending you a fairy play
entitled</i> &ldquo;<i>For Love of the King</i>,&rdquo; <i>just
for your own amusement</i>.&nbsp; <i>It is the outcome of long
and luminous talks <!-- page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span

the Temple and on the river</i>, <i>in the days when I was
meditating writing a novel as beautiful and as intricate as a
Persian praying-rug</i>.&nbsp; <i>I hope that I have caught the
atmosphere</i>.</p>
<p><i>I should like to see it acted in your Garden House on some
night when the sky is a sheet of violet and the stars like
women&rsquo;s eyes</i>.&nbsp; <i>Alas</i>, <i>it is not
likely</i>.</p>
<p><i>I am in the throes of a new comedy</i>.&nbsp; <i>I met a
perfectly wonderful person the other day who unconsciously has
irradiated my present with sinuous suggestion</i>: <i>a Swedish
Baron</i>, <i>French in manner</i>, <i>Athenian in mind</i>,
<i>and Oriental in morals</i>.&nbsp; <i>His society is a series
of revelations</i>. . . .</p>

<h3>SCENE I</h3>
<p><i>The palace of the</i> <span class="smcap">king of
burmah</span>.&nbsp; <i>The scene is laid in the Hall of a
Hundred Doors</i>.&nbsp; <i>In the distance can be seen the
moat</i>, <i>the waiting elephants</i>, <i>and the peacocks
promenading proudly in the blinding sunshine of late
afternoon</i>.&nbsp; <i>The scene discovers</i> <span
class="smcap">king meng beng</span> <i>seated on a raised cushion
sewn with rubies</i>, <i>under a canopy supported by four
attendants</i>, <i>motionless as bronze figures</i>.&nbsp; <i>By
his side is a betel-nut box</i>, <i>glittering with
gems</i>.&nbsp; <i>On either side of him</i>, <i>but </i><!--
page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

class="smcap">two ambassadors of the king of ceylon</span>,
<i>bearers of the King of Ceylon&rsquo;s consent to the marriage
of his only daughter to Meng Beng in two years&rsquo; time</i>,
<i>men of grave</i>, <i>majestic mien</i>, <i>clad in flowing
robes almost monastic in their white simplicity</i>.&nbsp;
<i>They smoke gravely at the invitation of</i> <span
class="smcap">meng beng</span>.</p>
<p><i>Round about are grouped the courtiers</i>, <i>the
poonygees</i>, <i>and the kneeling servants</i>, <i>while in the
background wait the dancing girls</i>.&nbsp; <i>Banners</i>,
<i>propelled with a measured rhythm</i>, <i>create an agreeable
breeze</i>.&nbsp; <i>On a great table of gold stand goblets of
gold and heaped-up fruits</i>.&nbsp; <i>Everywhere will be
observed the emblems of the Royal Peacock and the Sacred White
Elephant</i>.&nbsp; <i>Burmese musical instruments sound an
abrupt but charming discord</i>.&nbsp; <i>The poinsettias flower
punctuates points of deepest </i><!-- page 3--><a

out of vases fashioned like the lotus</i>.&nbsp; <i>Orchids are
everywhere</i>.&nbsp; <i>The indescribable scent of Burmah steals
across the footlights</i>.&nbsp; <i>The glow</i>, <i>the
colour</i>, <i>the sun-swept vista sweeps across the
senses</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">the king</span> <i>claps
his hands</i>.&nbsp; <i>The</i> <span class="smcap">dancing
girls</span>, <i>at the signal</i>, <i>advance</i>.&nbsp; <i>They
are clad in dresses made of fish scales</i>, <i>which are
fastened with diamonds and pale emeralds</i>, <i>to imitate the
upthrown spray on the crest of a wave</i>.&nbsp; <i>The dance
concluded</i>, <i>the</i> <span class="smcap">cingalese
ambassadors</span> <i>rise and prepare to take ceremonious leave
of</i> <span class="smcap">the king</span>, <i>who hands to
them</i>, <i>through his</i> <span class="smcap">vizier</span>,
<i>his message to His Majesty of Ceylon</i>, <i>inscribed on palm
leaves and enclosed in a bejewelled casket</i>.</p>
<p><i>Many flowery speeches pass</i>.&nbsp; <i>Exit</i>
(<i>L.</i>), <i>walking backwards</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">the king</span> <i>expresses a desire for
rest </i><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span

<p><i>The Crowd break up into groups</i>.&nbsp; <span

of the King to interference in affairs of State</i>; <i>his
extreme youth and delicacy of temperament</i>; <i>the pity that
the marriage is to be so long delayed</i>; <i>the necessity to
find him some distraction in the meantime</i>.</p>
<p><i>Suddenly the tom-toms sound loudly</i>.&nbsp; <i>There is
much movement</i>.&nbsp; <i>The moon rises over the
sea</i>.&nbsp; <i>Torches flare as the attendants move to and fro
in the gardens beyond</i>.</p>
<p><i>The White Elephant of the King</i>, <i>with </i><!-- page

trappings of gold</i>, <i>is led to the entrance where</i>, <i>at
a word</i>, <i>it sinks obediently to the ground</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">the king</span> <i>appears</i>.&nbsp;
<i>He has changed his gay apple-green dress to one of more sombre
hue</i>.&nbsp; <i>He enters the howdah</i>&mdash;<i>the elephant
rises</i>&mdash;<i>the procession starts</i>.&nbsp; <i>It
consists of not fewer than two hundred persons</i>, <i>keeping in
view of the audience until lost by a bend in the avenue</i>.</p>

impossible for her to sell her cucumbers or her

of priceless metals with heads that move</i>, <i>swinging banners
with fringes of many-coloured stones</i>, <i>lanterns with glass
slides on which are painted grotesque figures</i>.&nbsp; <i>The

words</i>.&nbsp; <i>He tells it that the fear of everyone is that

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
